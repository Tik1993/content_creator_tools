# Content Creator Assistant 

This project is inspired by the [LangChain Academy: Intro to LangGraph course](https://academy.langchain.com/courses/intro-to-langgraph).
The goal is to build an AI-powered assistant that helps generate product review posts.

## 🚀 Project Goal  
The assistant is designed to simulate customer interactions and create meaningful product reviews that can later be used for content creation (e.g., social media posts, product pages, or blogs).

## 🛠️ How It Works  
The workflow involves three main steps:  

1. **Create Customers**  
   - Generate synthetic customers with profiles such as name, occupation, and preferences.  

2. **Ask Questions**  
   - Engage with the customers by asking relevant questions.  
   - Search for their preferred products and compare them to the current product being reviewed.  

3. **Generate Summary**  
   - Use the collected feedback to create a structured product review summarizing the customers’ opinions.
